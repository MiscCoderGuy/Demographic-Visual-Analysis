** Demographic-Visual-Analysis **

  1) Prints a 2-D background image of the United States of America, breaking out the states, with points or coordinates designating some driving factor [a zip code table file].

  2) The front-end portion of the project is mostly complete. I am now working on the back-end logic, with plans of connecting the front and back-ends very soon.
     Essentially, the aim of the application is to show a visual demographic analysis of a large dataset. This idea came to me when I caught my first IT/ Software Development break and
     wanted to extend my capabilities to new heights and develop something cool that interests me. It's intended for ease of use and fun with whatever dataset you're incorporating.

  4) Thank you for expressing your interest in this application. If you wish to collaborate, please send me email correspondence and I will get back with you as soon as I possibly can.
